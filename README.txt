This Repo contains various files. It's not a project that will change the face of the world yet, but I included a Python file that prints the prime numbers from 3 to 100.

I also created a small poem in my third commit. My fourth commit will consist in the add of this line in this file. I think that will end the exercise !

In fact I just realized I pushed on GitHub after each commit at the beginning of this exercise. I think it was not necessary, so I decided to make two commit at the end before the final push. The adding of this line will be part of my last commit.
